### A program for classifying human and gorilla skeletal structures using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the You Only Look Once (YOLO) method


#### Description:
A Python project for classifying and analyzing human and gorilla skeletal structures using deep learning. 
Supports headless execution, GUI (PyQt5), Docker, and Jupyter demonstration. 

**This repository includes:**
- **Core code**: model inference, preprocessing, evaluation, and database logic (`core/`).  
- **GUI (PyQt5)**: user-facing interface for loading images & videos and seeing results (`gui/`).  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: full pipeline demo and reproducible tutorial (`skeleton-analyzer.ipynb`).  
- **Docker & docker-compose**: for running in isolated, reproducible environments (especially headless mode).  
- **Data folders & example images**: to test image/video inference and evaluation.  

#### Install Project Dependencies
``` 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

#### Running the Project (Python)
```# Headless mode
python main.py --mode headless

# GUI mode (requires local display)
python main.py --mode gui

# Auto mode (detects GUI or headless automatically)
python main.py --mode auto
```
**Note:**
Headless mode is suitable for servers, CI/CD pipelines, or testing without a display.
GUI mode requires PyQt5 and a local display environment.

#### Docker Setup
##### 1. Build the Docker Image:

The ``` Dockerfile```  defines a reusable image called ```skeleton-analyzer```. To build it:

``` 
# From the project root directory
docker-compose build
``` 
This will:
- Install Python dependencies (```requirements.txt```).
- Set up the project structure.
- Prepare the image for headless execution.    
After building, the image will be reusable and stored locally.  
##### 2. Run the Project in a Container: 
To run the project in headless mode inside a container:
``` 
docker-compose run skeleton-analyzer 
``` 
**What this does:**
- Creates a container from the skeleton-analyzer image.
- Mounts your local Data/ folder into /app/Data in the container.
- Runs the project in headless mode.
- Prints environment validation, available evaluations, and skeletal images.    

##### 3. Optional: Running GUI Mode:
Running GUI inside Docker is not recommended for Windows without additional setup (X11, VNC). For GUI testing, itâ€™s easier to run the project locally using Python:
``` 
python main.py --mode gui
``` 
**Note:** For full demonstration, the Jupyter notebook (skeleton-analyzer.ipynb) provides a complete GUI-like layout and workflow. You can use it to test the GUI and pipeline without running the PyQt5 application inside Docker.


##### 4. Stop and Remove Containers:   
After testing, you can remove containers while keeping the image reusable:
``` 
docker-compose down
``` 
Your ``` skeleton-analyzer``` image remains locally and can be reused to create new containers.
 
#### Testing the Project

##### 1. Test single Image Inference:
```
from core.model import SkeletonModel
model = SkeletonModel()
model.load_model()
result = model.analyze_image("Data/Human_Skeletal/sample.jpg")
print(result['predictions'])
```

##### 2. Test batch Image Inference:
```
from core.preprocessing import ImageManager
image_paths = ImageManager.get_skeletal_images('human')
for img_path in image_paths:
    result = model.analyze_image(img_path)
    print(result['predictions'])

```
##### 3. Test video Inference:
```
detections = model.analyze_video("Data/sample_video.mp4")
print(f"Total detections: {len(detections)}")

```
##### 4. Test model Evaluation Utilities:
```
from core.evaluation import ModelEvaluator
available = ModelEvaluator.get_available_evaluations()
print(available)

for eval_type in available:
    images = ModelEvaluator.get_evaluation_images(eval_type)
    print(f"{eval_type}: {len(images)} images")

```
##### 5. Test GUI (PyQt5):
```
from gui.app import run_gui
run_gui()

```
GUI allows image/video selection, evaluation display, and login management.


#### ðŸ“’ Jupyter Notebook (skeleton-analyzer.ipynb)
##### The file skeleton-analyzer.ipynb demonstrates the full pipeline in one place: 
- Load skeletal datasets.
- Run training and inference.
- Generate evaluation metrics and plots.
- Perform image & video analysis.     

ðŸ‘‰ This notebook serves as a tutorial / reproducibility showcase.
